# Add my MathProject for the CodeOfLouisville requirement 2019,Jul 26.

This is my project for the Course of Louisville Front End Development.
The project is name as : MathProject.
Basically, it just an attempt to help kid trainning and playing with number
of multiplication.

The web page will print out 2 numbers in the range of 1-99, so kids at level 4th grader
or bigger can try their best to win the test.
